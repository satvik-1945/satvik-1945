👋 Hi, I’m Satvik Tejas

Machine Learning Engineer | NLP & Retrieval Systems | IIIT Bhopal (GPA 9.38)

I build AI systems from first principles — from neural networks written in NumPy to production-style LLM orchestration systems.

🧠 What I Work On
	•	Representation Learning (Word2Vec, embeddings)
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Vector DB systems)
	•	OCR + Named Entity Recognition pipelines
	•	Distributed system design for AI applications
	•	Neural networks implemented from scratch
	•	Ontology → RDF → Knowledge graph pipelines

🚀 Featured Projects

🔹 ChatKart AI(currently under development)

  AI-powered commerce assistant with:
    •	LLM orchestration
    •	Vector similarity search
    •	MongoDB metadata joins
    •	Payment gateway integration
    •	Webhook-based confirmation
    •	Modular checkout architecture

  🔹 Word2Vec From Scratch

Implemented:
	•	CBOW (one-hot + embedding lookup variants)
	•	Skip-gram
	•	Negative sampling
	•	Embedding visualization

Built to deeply understand representation learning without PyTorch abstractions.

🔹 Neural Network From Scratch

Built:
	•	Forward & backward propagation
	•	Custom loss functions
	•	Training loops in NumPy
	•	Modular inference engine

⚙️ Tech Stack

Languages:
	•	Python
	•	C++
	•	JavaScript / Node.js
	•	TypeScript

ML / AI:
	•	NumPy
	•	PyTorch
	•	HuggingFace
	•	Tesseract OCR
	•	Vector Databases

Backend / Infra:
	•	MongoDB
	•	Elasticsearch
	•	REST APIs
	•	Async workflows
	•	Webhooks
	•	Docker
  🧩 How I Think About ML

I focus on understanding:
	•	How embeddings are actually computed
	•	How gradients flow through networks
	•	How retrieval systems scale
	•	How to design AI systems beyond notebooks

I care about internals, not just APIs.
