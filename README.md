# 👋 Hi, I’m Satvik Tejas

**Machine Learning Engineer | NLP & Retrieval Systems | IIIT Bhopal (GPA 9.38)**  

I build AI systems from first principles — from neural networks written in NumPy to production-style LLM orchestration systems.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- Representation Learning (Word2Vec, embeddings)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Vector DB systems)
- OCR + Named Entity Recognition pipelines
- Distributed system design for AI applications
- Neural networks implemented from scratch
- Ontology → RDF → Knowledge graph pipelines

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 ChatKart AI *(Currently Under Development)*

AI-powered commerce assistant with:

- LLM orchestration layer  
- Vector similarity search  
- MongoDB metadata joins  
- Payment gateway integration  
- Webhook-based confirmation  
- Modular checkout architecture  

---

### 🔹 Word2Vec From Scratch

Implemented:

- CBOW (one-hot + embedding lookup variants)
- Skip-gram
- Negative sampling
- Embedding visualization

Built to deeply understand representation learning without relying on high-level framework abstractions.

---

### 🔹 Neural Network From Scratch

Built:

- Forward & backward propagation
- Custom loss functions
- Training loops in NumPy
- Modular inference engine

Designed to understand gradient flow and optimization mechanics at a fundamental level.

## 🧩 How I Think About ML

I focus on understanding:

- How embeddings are actually computed  
- How gradients flow through networks  
- How retrieval systems scale  
- How to design AI systems beyond notebooks  

I care about internals, not just APIs.
